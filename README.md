# Heart-Rate-Monitor-
A Heart Rate Monitor is a health monitoring system designed to measure a personâ€™s pulse rate in real time. It uses a pulse sensor or photoplethysmograph (PPG) to detect heartbeats and sends the data to a microcontroller for processing. The measured heart rate is then displayed on an LCD or transmitted to a mobile app for tracking.
